Application:
  name: ArtifactoryCLI
  service: artifactory
  prefix: atfcli
  description: |-
    Specification for a commandline client for Artifactory, based on the
    Artifactory REST API specification.

    The basic commandline syntax is:
    cli ::= <built-in-command> | <regular-command>
    built-in-command ::= 'help' | 'set' | 'nouns' | 'verbs' | 'shell' | 'exit'
    regular-command ::= <verb> [ <arguments> ] <noun> [ <arguments> ]

    Basic application configuration (such as definition of server
    connections) is done in a separate yml file names
    ~/.cscli_preferences (however, this should be configurable as
    well).

    The specification consists of a sequence of resource definitions,
    each of which consisting of a sequence of commands. The resources
    (or objects) are referenced as /nouns/, the commands applicable to
    an object are referenced as /verbs/. The idea is to provide a
    commandline interface that resembles natural language (eg. "list
    projects --members <project-name>" or "list webhooks --in
    <project>", etc.), and keeps the vocabulary as small as possible -
    one should not remember a distinct, separate list- or
    describe-command for each resource, but reuse the generic verb
    that is common for all kinds of resources.

    The resource definition sequence starts with a "dummy" resource,
    called 'DUMMY_FOR_OPTIONS'. No command module will be generated
    for this resource. Its only purpose is to provide a central
    location where all the option specifications are defined
    (anchored), so that they can be simply referenced in the following
    command definitions.

    - &opt-all
      switchspec: all|a
      varname: all
      description: |-2
                Do not restrict output by any kind of built-in filter
                logic, such as only listing projects that are listed
                in one of the caller's namespaces.

                Note, that requesting all possible entries may result
                in extended response times because of Artifactory's
                paginating API returns (i.e. there may be many
                sequential GET requests involved). 
    - &opt-as
      switchspec: as=s
      varname: perm
      description: |-2
                Specify the role or permission level granted to the user for
                which the command is run.
                
                Permission levels are specified numerically.
                The following levels can be granted to a user:
                   10 => Guest access
                   20 => Reporter access
                   30 => Developer access
                   40 => Master access

      varname: desc
      description: |-2
                Specify a short (quoted) description for a Artifactory resource object.

                If the argument has the form /@<filename>/, then the program
                attempts to find a file with the specified name, and reads the
                description from this file, if one is found.
    - &opt-disable

                identified in the comma-separated list of option
                keywords. Each of the options is taken to be a boolean
                that is set to 'false' if the keyword is listed.

      description: |-2
                The --events option determines, which Artifactory events trigger
                the webhook. The argument to the --event option is a
                comma-separated sequence of one or more Artifactory events.
                The following event keywords are known:
                    push

      varname: force
    - &opt-format
      switchspec: format|fmt=s
      varname: format
      description: |-2
                Specify a template string to define a custom format
                for the produced output.
                
                The string argument can be a filename containing the
                format template, or a verbatim template string.
                
                Template strings consist of regular text that is kept
                verbatim in the output, and /format codes/ that are
                substituted by fields in the found data items. Format
                codes start with a '%' and are followed by a letter
                indicating the data field that is to be substituted.
                
                The following format codes are recognized:
                  %F:<fieldname> - generic field access: the expression
                       %F:<fieldname> is substituted by the value of
                       specified field as found in the object descriptor.
                       In many cases, available field names can be
                       obtained by list or describe of an object with
                       the --long option.
                  %H - the HTTPS URL of the object (if available)
                  %i - the numeric id of the object
                  %I - the URL encoded id of the object
                  %n - the name of the object (if available - if not,
                       an empty string is substituted)
                  %N - the name_with_path of an object
                  %p - the path of the object
                  %P - the full_path of the object
                  %S - the ssh URL of the object (if available)
                  %U - the web URL of the object (if available)

    - &opt-id
      switchspec: id=i
      varname: id
    - &opt-in
      switchspec: in=s
      varname: in
      description: |-2
                This is a generic option to specify a context object - usually
                some kind of namespace - for an operation. The particular
                context depends on the /noun/ in the command expression.

                Example:
                * in a 'list projects --in <group>', the referenced context is a
                  /group/ namespace.
                * in a 'add webhook --in <project>', the referenced context is
                  a /project/ object.

                In any case, the argument to the --in switch can be a proper
                object id (numeric, or url encoded pathname), or a unique
                object name.

                If the argument to --in references a project, this project
                is cached in the internal variable 'current_project'. If
                'current_project' is defined it is implicitly assumed as
                argument to --in, i.e. it is not necessary to specify the
                project context more than once in multiple subsequent commands
                that apply to the same project.
    - &opt-json
      switchspec: json
      varname: json
      description: |-2
                Descriptive output is printed as JSON document. This is useful
                for further automated prcessing of the returned information.
    - &opt-aql
      switchspec: jql=s
      varname: jql   
      description: |-2
                Specify a (quoted) JQL query for a Artifactory issue search expression.

                If the argument has the form /@<filename>/, then the program
                attempts to find a file with the specified name, and reads the
                description from this file, if one is found.
    - &opt-labels
      switchspec: labels=s
      varname: labels
      description: |-2
                Comma-separated list of labels for the merge request.

      description: |-2

                attributes for the respective resource.
                If this switch is used together with the --json switch, then
                all raw data as returned by the API call is printed as JSON
                document. 
    - &opt-merge
      varname: can_merge

                object. If a protoype object is specified, all
                relevant attributes of the object are used to set an
                initial value for the respective attribute in the
                newly created object.
